            Before the module began, we were given a set of problem statements
            ranging from digital solutions from OCBC to social entrepreneurship
            in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. With my level of competency in terms of
            programming, I chose the problem statement which seemed to me has
            the least coding involved.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the first week of my Portfolio Development (PFD) module, I came
            into the class with absolutely no expectations or whatsoever as we
            were only given a problem statement. I thought to myself that maybe
            this is another design thinking module similar to Innovation Made
            Possible (IMP) which is to utilize design thinking and create a
            prototype without any coding involved. However, after the first
            lesson I was taken aback by what this module is really about. We
            were tasked to implement full stack development in this module in
            response to the problem statement given. The problem statement I
            chose to work on was about sustainability at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.
            In the second lesson, an activity was conducted to determine how our
            groups were formed which was done by the selection of people's
            strength and weakness such that everyone has a chance to work with
            someone they do not know but through their abilities. My group
            consisted of 5 people from different classes. We introduced
            ourselves and stated our strengths to one another, and with that
            concludes the first week of PFD.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the second week, both lessons were spent ideating on a solution
            based on our given problem statement. Communications was definitely
            lacking in these lessons as we were slowly trying to get acquainted
            with each other. As such, individually we researched on the types of
            sustainability there are to gain a better understanding to the
            problem statement. At this point, I started to feel worried based on
            what kind of product we eventually have to create. This is because,
            in the first week, we shared our strengths and weaknesses, and our
            entire group is not competent in programming at all. Hence, I
            started to feel that creating a solution with full stack development
            will be a daunting task.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the third and fourth week, we started having a rough idea on the
            prototype we aim in creating which was to create an informative
            website for our chosen sustainability category. Throughout these
            weeks, we encountered various of hiccups along the way. Initially,
            we chose e-waste sustainability as it is not a concept that is being
            touched on as concise as other types of sustainability in Ngee Ann
            Polytechnic. We first thought of an idea which is to hold an
            “E-waste Fiesta” week where students and staffs can bring their
            electronic waste to school and donate it. However, it came with
            problems like “How does it answer the problem statement since no
            technology was used?” and “Even if we held this fiesta, students
            will not be encouraged because there are no incentives. Even if
            there is an incentive, where can we get the funding from?”. We were
            stuck on ideating a solution where funding is not an issue and how
            we can implement technology (full stack development) into it. As a
            result, we decided to take a 180 degree turn and change our
            direction to food sustainability. We consulted with our lecturer, Dr
            Joel Yang, and he advised us to stick to e-waste sustainability
            because it is an interesting topic that is both a current and
            important issue in today’s society. As such, we decided to stick to
            e-waste sustainability and work our way from there. We had an
            opportunity to visit Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s Integrated Operations
            Centre (IOC) which was truly one of the most interesting parts in
            this module. A mini tour was conducted by Mr Charles Keck where he
            showed us how the IOC was operated, ranging from how campus security
            is implemented, electricity is monitored and what was being done to
            work towards a “Green Campus”. The tour made me realised how
            wonderful and important technology is in tackling multiple global
            issues and also aid in advocating a sustainable lifestyle to
            everyone. Eventually, we settled on addressing the issue of e-waste
            sustainability in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Our group finalized on an
            idea which was to create an informative website that has
            functionalities similar to Carousell. We decided to start working on
            our website early to get the necessary requirements ready for the
            hackathon in week 5.
          </p>

          <p>
            The day of the Hackathon finally arrived. I was having mixed
            feelings about it because this is my first ever Hackathon experience
            and I was not sure what to expect from this. We started off the
            first day of the Hackathon with an introductory speech by one of the
            Deputy Directors of the school and mentioned the various activities
            and food provided throughout the Hackathon. After which we
            dissipated to our respective rooms to work on our product. From
            around 9am all the way to 6pm, my group and I was working on our
            prototype, making sure we were able to implement our planned
            functionalities onto our website. It was really a very tough and
            energy-draining process as we encountered various of problems code
            wise that we had to troubleshoot. It was also mainly because one of
            our group members was unable to attend the Hackathon, leading us to
            take on her part of the work which made it even more stressful than
            it already is. Thankfully, the snacks and drinks provided definitely
            served as an energy replenisher for us.
          </p>

          <p>
            Undoubtedly, the first day of the Hackathon was filled with large
            amount of frustration and tiredness. However, coming into the second
            day, things were much better as I now know what to expect from it.
            Similar to the first day, our group worked tirelessly to make sure
            we implement our planned features onto our website regardless of the
            challenges faced. It was for sure much more smooth sailing as
            compared to the first day. I still remember as soon as the time hit
            5.45pm, that was the time I led out a sigh of relief that not only
            has the torturous journey has ended, but we also managed to finish
            our prototype. It was definitely a sight to see the smiles on my
            teammates’ faces as our hard work has finally come into fruition.
          </p>

          <p>
            Coming into the final day of the Hackathon which is our
            presentation. Despite being confident in showcasing our work, I have
            to admit that I was definitely not very proud of it simply because
            it did not look aesthetically pleasing, and our functionalities were
            certainly lacking. However, I was still happy to present it to the
            judges and the class to show the amount of hard work and time put
            into this. After our presentation, the judges, Dr Joel Yang and Mr
            Charles Keck complimented on our idea and gave us improvements to
            work on for our prototype. This was when I felt a heavy weight
            lifted up from my shoulders that I am finally free from this
            Hackathon. We ended the Hackathon with a closing speech by Dr Joel
            Yang as well as a Lucky Draw.

          <p>
            Without a doubt, there are much to be improved on for our website in
            which we intend to incorporate the judges comments, as well as other
            good-to-have features that are commonly found in these type of
            websites. Until Term 2 starts, I went on a break having to forget
            the entire module completely.
          </p>

          <p>
            After the new years, term 2 started which commences the start of PFD
            module again. Honestly, it was hard to kick start my engine again
            and have the motivation to continue improving on our prototype, but
            because I was the unanimously decided group leader, I had to lead my
            team to complete the various improvements we were told and wanted to
            do by the end of the assignment.
          </p>

          <p>
            The beginning of week 12 was very dreadful, not only was there
            multiple assignments starting for other modules as well, but the
            thought of improving our website isn't exactly the most exciting
            thing. To start things off, I decided that it was time for a better
            UI/UX design to our website as it currently lacks both
            professionalism and aestheticism. After researching on various
            similiar websites and inspirations, I have finally found a design
            that is simple yet aesthetically pleasing which was what we ended up
            using for our final prototype. In addition to this, I also revamped
            our sign in and sign up page which was atrociously designed
            previously as I lacked the time management during the Hackathon.
            That practically summed up the entire experience of week 12 for PFD.
          </p>

          <p>
            Coming into week 13-16, this was it felt like I am reliving the
            times from the Hackathon. In week 13, after redesigning the entire
            website, I wanted to test the uploading of products into our
            "Marketplace". All of a sudden, the items that was uploaded could
            not be retrieved from the database and displayed onto our
            "Marketplace" page. This caused me to immediately panicked as this
            was one of the most important feature of our prototype and if it
            does not work, our prototype will literally be rendered as useless.
            At that time, everyone else was busy with their assignments and was
            not able to help in fixing this error that I came across. Seeing
            that I was not the one who coded this functionality, it took me a
            long and torturous 4 hours to resolve this issue. What made it worse
            was that the error all lied in one line of code which happened to be
            a logic flaw. However, all of this is part of the experience as a
            person in the field of IT.
          </p>

          <p>
            The stress for me was definitely piling up in week 13 and 14 as not
            only do I have to handle countless of assignments I had from other
            modules, but I have to also think of useful functionalities that
            will be useful for our website and code them out. In all honesty, it
            is very obvious that everyone hated PFD module for various of
            reasons, mainly is the way group formation was done where everyone
            would pick people whose strengths are good at coding which lead to
            an eventual imbalance of coding abilities amongst groups. This was
            perhaps why I would say my group was not particulaly motivated in
            this assignment as well as our grade for this module does not
            transalate to the amount of hard work put into it. Hence, I started
            getting stressed about the completion of the prototype as at that
            point I was the only one trying to salvage from our situation to at
            least showcase a better product as before.
          </p>

          <p>
            On the bright side, I managed to complete various of functionalities
            both on the front-end and back-end through week 13-16. There was
            definitely countless of ups and downs along the way, ranging from
            the happiness of successfully incorporating a workable functionality
            to the website, to the endless amount of errors implementing my
            functionalities. On top of my own contributions, I had to fix my
            other groupmates codes and errors which was certainly not enjoyable
            but was a fulfilling experience that for once, as someone who is not
            particularly incline in the technical aspect, they would rely on me
            to fix their errors. Here are some pictures to display the
            improvements made.

            To say the least, this entire experience was not a total
            disappointment at all. It was an overall very enriching and
            fulfilling experience as it certainly tested my mental fortitude
            throughout the Hackathon. Not only am I thankful for the opportunity
            Ngee Ann Polytechnic has given me, but I am also grateful for my 3
            other teammates who were with me on this rigorous journey. Despite
            us all being from different classes and only trying to get
            acquainted with each other twice every week, our bonds were
            certainly strengthened during the Hackathon and needless to say, at
            the end of the module. We complemented each other really well as we
            leveraged on each other strengths and convert our weaknesses into
            motivation and commitment such that we were able to overcome the
            myriad of obstacles faced. I am really glad we resolved any
            impediments without conflicts and managed to produce a prototype we
            were all really satisfied with. If there was another opportunity for
            me to partake in another experience similar to this, I will
            definitely sign up for it without any hesitation.

            Most importantly, a huge amount of gratitude and appreciation have
            to be shown towards my lecturer, Dr Joel Yang, who was someone that
            went the extra mile as not just being our lecturer, but certainly
            the strongest pillar of support for the entirety of this module. A
            huge thanks is also needed to be said to my groupmates, Adam, Keanan
            and Jia Yuan for doing their best and executing their
            responsibilites to eventually create this website that we are all
            proud of. Needless to say, this will definitely be a core memory in
            Ngee Ann Polytechnic.
