            Before the module began, we were given a set of problem statements
            ranging from digital solutions from OCBC to social entrepreneurship
            in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. With my level of competency in terms of
            programming, I chose the problem statement which seemed to me has
            the least coding involved.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the first week of my Portfolio Development (PFD) module, I came
            into the class with absolutely no expectations or whatsoever as we
            were only given a problem statement. I thought to myself that maybe
            this is another design thinking module similar to Innovation Made
            Possible (IMP) which is to utilize design thinking and create a
            prototype without any coding involved. However, after the first
            lesson I was taken aback by what this module is really about. We
            were tasked to implement full stack development in this module in
            response to the problem statement given. The problem statement I
            chose to work on was about sustainability at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.
            In the second lesson, an activity was conducted to determine how our
            groups were formed which was totally by random such that everyone
            has a chance to work with someone they do not know. My group
            consisted of 5 people from different classes. We introduced
            ourselves and stated our strengths to one another, and with that
            concludes the first week of PFD.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the second week, both lessons were spent ideating on a solution
            based on our given problem statement. Communications was definitely
            lacking in these lessons as we were slowly trying to get acquainted
            with each other. As such, individually we researched on the types of
            sustainability there are to gain a better understanding to the
            problem statement. At this point, I started to feel worried based on
            what kind of product we eventually have to create. This is because,
            in the first week, we shared our strengths and weaknesses, and our
            entire group is not competent in programming at all. Hence, I
            started to feel that creating a solution with full stack development
            will be a daunting task.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the third and fourth week, we started having a rough idea on the
            prototype we aim in creating which was to create an informative
            website for our chosen sustainability category. Throughout these
            weeks, we encountered various of hiccups along the way. Initially,
            we chose e-waste sustainability as it is not a concept that is being
            touched on as concise as other types of sustainability in Ngee Ann
            Polytechnic. We first thought of an idea which is to hold an
            “E-waste Fiesta” week where students and staffs can bring their
            electronic waste to school and donate it. However, it came with
            problems like “How does it answer the problem statement since no
            technology was used?” and “Even if we held this fiesta, students
            will not be encouraged because there are no incentives. Even if
            there is an incentive, where can we get the funding from?”. We were
            stuck on ideating a solution where funding is not an issue and how
            we can implement technology (full stack development) into it. As a
            result, we decided to take a 180 degree turn and change our
            direction to food sustainability. We consulted with our lecturer, Dr
            Joel Yang, and he advised us to stick to e-waste sustainability
            because it is an interesting topic that is both a current and
            important issue in today’s society. As such, we decided to stick to
            e-waste sustainability and work our way from there. We had an
            opportunity to visit Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s Integrated Operations
            Centre (IOC) which was truly one of the most interesting parts in
            this module. A mini tour was conducted by Mr Charles Keck where he
            showed us how the IOC was operated, ranging from how campus security
            is implemented, electricity is monitored and what was being done to
            work towards a “Green Campus”. The tour made me realised how
            wonderful and important technology is in tackling multiple global
            issues and also aid in advocating a sustainable lifestyle to
            everyone. Eventually, we settled on addressing the issue of e-waste
            sustainability in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. Our group finalized on an
            idea which was to create an informative website that has
            functionalities similar to Carousell. We decided to start working on
            our website early to get the necessary requirements ready for the
            hackathon in week 5.
          </p>

          <p>
            The day of the Hackathon finally arrived. I was having mixed
            feelings about it because this is my first ever Hackathon experience
            and I was not sure what to expect from this. We started off the
            first day of the Hackathon with an introductory speech by one of the
            Deputy Directors of the school and mentioned the various activities
            and food provided throughout the Hackathon. After which we
            dissipated to our respective rooms to work on our product. From
            around 9am all the way to 6pm, my group and I was working on our
            prototype, making sure we were able to implement our planned
            functionalities onto our website. It was really a very tough and
            energy-draining process as we encountered various of problems code
            wise that we had to troubleshoot. It was also mainly because one of
            our group members was unable to attend the Hackathon, leading us to
            take on her part of the work which made it even more stressful than
            it already is. Thankfully, the snacks and drinks provided definitely
            served as an energy replenisher for us.
          </p>

          <p>
            Undoubtedly, the first day of the Hackathon was filled with large
            amount of frustration and tiredness. However, coming into the second
            day, things were much better as I now know what to expect from it.
            Similar to the first day, our group worked tirelessly to make sure
            we implement our planned features onto our website regardless of the
            challenges faced. It was for sure much more smooth sailing as
            compared to the first day. I still remember as soon as the time hit
            5.45pm, that was the time I led out a sigh of relief that not only
            has the torturous journey has ended, but we also managed to finish
            our prototype. It was definitely a sight to see the smiles on my
            teammates’ faces as our hard work has finally come into fruition.
          </p>

          <p>
            Coming into the final day of the Hackathon, I was feeling more
            confident than ever. I was very prepared to showcase to both the
            class and judges our final prototype that our group has worked
            continuously on. After our presentation, the judges, Dr Joel Yang
            and Mr Charles Keck complimented on our idea and gave us
            improvements to work on for our prototype. This was when I felt a
            heavy weight lifted up from my shoulders that I am finally free from
            this Hackathon. We ended the Hackathon with a closing speech by Dr
            Joel Yang as well as a Lucky Draw.
          </p>

          <p>
            To say the least, this Hackathon definitely did not disappoint. It
            was an overall very enriching and fulfilling experience as it
            certainly tested my mental fortitude throughout this Hackathon. Not
            only am I thankful for the experience Ngee Ann Polytechnic has given
            us, but I am also grateful for my 3 other teammates who were with me
            on this rigorous journey. Despite us all being from different
            classes and only trying to get acquainted with each other twice
            every week, our bonds were certainly strengthened during the
            Hackathon. We complemented each other really well as we leveraged on
            each other strengths and convert our weaknesses into motivation and
            commitment such that we were able to overcome the myriad of
            obstacles faced. I am really glad we resolved any impediments
            without conflicts and managed to produce a prototype we were all
            really satisfied with. If there was another opportunity for me to
            partake in another Hackathon similar to this, I will definitely sign
            up for it without any hesitation.
